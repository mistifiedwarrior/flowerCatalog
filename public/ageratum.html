          They form tussocks or small hills. They grow to a height of 30 in. The
          opposite leaves are cordate or oval, hairy or tomentose. The margins
          are slightly toothed or serrate. The leaves form compact clusters.

          spread in small compound umbels. They give small, dry fruits.
